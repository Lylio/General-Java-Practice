that compute the volume and surface area of a sphere with a radius r, a cylinder with
a circular base with radius r and height h, and a cone with a circular base with radius r
and height h. Place them into a class Geometry.
Then write a program that prompts the
user for the values of r and h, calls the six methods, and prints the results.
