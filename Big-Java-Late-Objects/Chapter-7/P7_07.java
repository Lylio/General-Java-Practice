 * word of a file and check whether it is contained in a word list. A word list is available
 * on most Linux systems in the file /usr/share/dict/words. (If you don’t have access
 * to a Linux system, your instructor should be able to get you a copy.) The program
 * should print out all words that it cannot find in the word list.
