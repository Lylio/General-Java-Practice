  * P5.21 In Exercise P3.26 you were asked to write a program to
  * convert a number to its representation
  * in Roman numerals.
  * At the time, you did not know how to eliminate duplicate
  * code, and as a consequence the resulting program was rather
  * long. Rewrite that program by implementing and using the
  * following method:
  * public static String romanDigit(int n, String one, String five, String ten)
  * That method translates one digit, using the strings specified for the one, five, and ten
  * values. You would call the method as follows:
  * romanOnes = romanDigit(n % 10, “I”, “V”, “X”);
  * n = n / 10;
  * romanTens = romanDigit(n % 10, “X”, “L”, “C”);
