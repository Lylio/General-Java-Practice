 * P6.25 Write a program that plays tic-tac-toe. The tic-tac-toe
 * game is played on a 3 × 3 grid as in the photo at right. The
 * game is played by two players, who take turns. The first
 * player marks moves with a circle, the second with a cross.
 * The player who has formed a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal
 * sequence of three marks wins. Your program should
 * draw the game board, ask the user for the coordinates of
 * the next mark, change the players after every successful
 * move, and pronounce the winner.
