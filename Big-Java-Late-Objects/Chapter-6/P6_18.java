 * P6.18 Magic squares. An n × n matrix that is filled with the numbers 1, 2, 3, . . ., n2 is a
 * magic square if the sum of the elements in each row, in each column, and in the two
 * diagonals is the same value.
 * Write a program that reads in 16 values from the keyboard and tests whether they
 * form a magic square when put into a 4 × 4 array. You need to test two features:
 * 1. Does each of the numbers 1, 2, ..., 16 occur in the user input?
 * 2. When the numbers are put into a square, are the sums of the rows, columns,
 * and diagonals equal to each other?
